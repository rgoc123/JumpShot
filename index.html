              <p>Welcome to JumpShot!</p>
              <p>Press Enter to start or re-start the game!</p>
              <p>The goal of the game is to score as many points as you can by moving the ball on to new platforms.</p>
              <p>Use the left and right arrows to move the ball, and get 10 points for every platform you land on. You'll level up every 200 points!</p>
              <p>But be careful: the platforms get smaller with each level.</p>
              <p>Don't let the ball go more than halfway out of bounds or drop to the bottom!</p>
